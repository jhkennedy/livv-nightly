This script is designed to: 
    1. Execute CISM's BATS
    1. Analyze the BATS output with LIVVkit
    3. Collate the new LIVVkit analysis with previous analyses
    4. Generate a webpage for all current analyses.

When combined with CRON, this will allow for nightly testing and analysis of
CISM with LIVVkit.
